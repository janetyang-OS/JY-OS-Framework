# JY-OS Framework (v1.0)
### A Modular Operating System for Human Survival & Self-Evolution in the AI Civilization Rift

> "When the rules change, survival becomes a design problem." — *Janet Yang*

**JY-OS** is not a philosophy; it is an engineering solution to a civilization-level problem. As AI accelerates and information entropy increases, the old human operating system (Legacy OS) is failing. JY-OS provides a full-stack architecture to ensure humans don't just survive the AI era, but achieve "Civilizational Escape Velocity."

## 🏗 The Architecture
The framework is built on four distinct layers, moving from physical constraints to behavioral execution.

### Layer 1: Kernel (Compute Sovereignty)
* **The Logic:** Physics is law. Energy is destiny.
* **The Problem:** AI is not just software; it is limited by energy and compute.
* **The Solution:** Understanding "Compute Sovereignty"—the new class divide between those who rent intelligence and those who own their compute stack.

### Layer 2: Firewall (Cognitive Security)
* **The Logic:** Attention is energy.
* **The Problem:** We live in a "Garbage Civilization" of high-entropy noise that depletes cognitive energy.
* **The Solution:** A "Cognitive Firewall" that filters input to protect deep thinking and prevent energy leakage.

### Layer 3: Interface (Orchestration Matrix)
* **The Logic:** Orchestration > Operation.
* **The Problem:** Treating AI as a tool rather than a team.
* **The Solution:** Moving from "using" AI to "commanding" a matrix of 6 personalities:
    * **The Spark:** For creativity and momentum.
    * **The Deep Diver:** For structured analysis.
    * **The Radar:** For facts and trends.
    * **The Architect:** For systems and frameworks.
    * **The Critic:** For error detection.
    * **The Executor:** For implementation.

### Layer 4: Runtime (The Super-Individual)
* **The Logic:** The OS must run automatically.
* **The Problem:** Knowledge does not equal capability.
* **The Solution:** The daily behavioral loops and "Family OS" protocols that allow an individual to evolve faster than the environment changes.

## 🚀 The Goal: Escape Velocity
The ultimate metric of JY-OS is not productivity, but **Civilizational Escape Velocity**. It is the ability of an individual (or family) to generate enough cognitive momentum to break free from the gravity of the Legacy OS and enter a new trajectory of self-evolution.
