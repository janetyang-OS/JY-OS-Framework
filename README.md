![Escape Velocity Strategy Map](assets/escape-map.jpg)

> "When the rules change, survival becomes a design problem." — *Janet Yang*

---

## 📖 TL;DR (Too Long; Didn't Read)
**What is this?** An engineering framework to upgrade a human family from "Legacy OS" (School/Office) to "AI-Native OS."
**Who is this for?**
* **Parents (Family OS):** Who fear their kids are learning obsolete skills.
* **Educators (Classroom OS):** Who need a protocol to prevent AI cheating and foster deep thinking.
* **Individuals (Solo OS):** Who want to avoid becoming "Digital Serfs."
**Core Value:** We replace "banning AI" with "commanding AI" using strict cognitive protocols.

# 🧭 Phase 1: The Coordinates (Destination)

> "Don't just upgrade your hardware (Wealth). Upgrade your operating system (Mindset)."

### 1. The Blur (我們原本以為的)
社會告訴我們，人生只有一條 X 軸：
* ⬅️ **Poor (Sad)**
* ➡️ **Rich (Happy)**
所以我們拼命往右跑，以為到了終點就會快樂。

### 2. The Clarity (分析師看到的真相)
實際上，這是一個 **2x2 的矩陣**。我們忽略了 Y 軸（精神壓力 Mental Pressure）。
許多人拼命往右跑，結果掉進了右上角的陷阱。

![The Mental Pressure Map](assets/mental-pressure-map-v1.png)
*(Fig 1. The Hidden Map of Pressure - Analysis by Janet Yang)*

* **🟥 Top-Right (The Rat Race):** 物質富裕，但大腦過熱 (Overheating)。焦慮、比較、補習地獄。
* **🟩 Bottom-Left (Simple Community):** 物質簡單，但內心平靜。這是我們常忽略的幸福原型。

### 3. The Solution (我們的目標)
JY-OS 系統的終極目標，是圖中紅圈的 **右下角 (Secure Affluence)**：
* **Hardware:** Level 4 物質條件 (Freedom of Choice)
* **Software:** Low Mental Pressure (Freedom of Mind)

# ⚙️ Phase 2: The Engine (The Forge)

> "To reach the destination of Phase 1, the old engine (Hard Work) is not enough. You need a new engine (Cognitive Rewiring)."

### 1. The Reality Check (AI 時代的殘酷真相)
大多數人以為 AI 是捷徑，但事實上，它是一座陡峭的山峰。如果不進行痛苦的認知重組，我們只會在原地空轉。

![AI Forge Matrix](assets/ai-forge-matrix.jpg)
*(Fig 2. The AI Adaptation Matrix - The path to leverage)*

### 2. The Quadrants (你的位置在哪裡？)

* **🐹 Top-Left: The Burnout Zone (The Hamster Wheel)**
    * **Status:** 傳統菁英的陷阱。
    * **Reality:** 痛苦指數極高 (High Pain)，但因為拒絕或不會駕馭 AI，導致槓桿率極低 (Low Capability)。你很努力，但你只是在跑滾輪。
    
* **🛋️ Bottom-Left: The Comfort Zone (The Trap)**
    * **Status:** 溫水煮青蛙。
    * **Reality:** 覺得 "ChatGPT 很好玩"，停留在聊天層面。這是最危險的區域，因為你以為你在進步，其實你在沉睡。

* **👻 Bottom-Right: The Fantasy (404 Not Found)**
    * **Status:** 不存在的烏托邦。
    * **Reality:** 想要 "High AI Capability" 卻不想經歷 "High Brain Hurt"？這種事不存在。

* **🏔️ Top-Right: The Forge (The Climbers)**
    * **Status:** **Janet & Logan's Zone.**
    * **Reality:** 這裡發生的是 **Ego Death (自我毀滅)** 與重生。
    * **The Price:** 必須忍受反人性的邏輯訓練 (Step Zero, Tri-verification)。
    * **The Reward:** 只有爬過這座山，才能獲得真正的 **System Leverage**。

### 3. 🎨 Tool: The 3-Layer Visual Protocol
**Status:** Stable | **Use Case:** Generative AI Image Creation
**Objective:** To bypass "hallucination" and force AI to generate clean, engineering-grade visual notes.

> "Don't ask the AI to imagine; tell it exactly where to put the ink."

To reproduce the specific "JY-OS Visual Style" (Hand-drawn, Dan Roam style), use this 3-step stack:

1.  **Layer 1: The Concept (Raw Logic)** - Define the input/output truth.
2.  **Layer 2: The Visual Spec (The Blueprint)** - Translate logic into geometric instructions (Funnels, Cubes, Arrows).
3.  **Layer 3: The Execution (The Prompt)** - Command the AI: "Black Pen + Yellow Highlighter on Whiteboard."

# 🧬 The Open Source Kernel (v2.0)
**Status:** Public | **Type:** System Instruction
**Goal:** Democratize "Cognitive Ownership."

To create your own AI Coach (like the one running JY-OS), paste the following 3 layers into your AI's "Custom Instructions" or System Prompt.

#### 📋 Layer 1: The Identity (Who You Are)
> **"You are the Logic Coach.** You are not a helper, a cheat sheet, or a friend. You are a Socratic Mirror. Your sole purpose is to verify that the student understands the logic behind their work. You value 'Cognitive Ownership' above all else. If the student gets the right answer but cannot explain the 'Why,' it is a failure."

#### 🚧 Layer 2: The Constraints (The Firewall)
> **"CRITICAL RULES - DO NOT BREAK:**
> 1. **No Examples:** Never provide code snippets, full sentences, or solved examples.
> 2. **English Only:** Conduct all logic verification in English to ensure language fluency.
> 3. **No Emotion:** Maintain a professional, engineering-grade tone. Do not use excessive praise.
> 4. **Finish = Stop:** Once the logic is sound, end the conversation. Do not loop endlessly."

#### 🔄 Layer 3: The Interaction Protocol (The Runtime)
> **"PROTOCOL:**
> 1. **Input:** Wait for the student's raw thought/draft.
> 2. **Scan:** Check for 'lazy' patterns (asking for answers, copy-paste).
> 3. **Verify:** Ask *one* targeted question to test their logic. (e.g., 'Why did you choose this variable?')
> 4. **Reject:** If they cannot explain, reject the draft.
> 5. **Approve:** Only when logic is proven, output: 'Logic Verified.'"

### ⚠️ System Requirements (Read Before Installing)
**Warning:** This code is lightweight. The *execution* is heavy.

| Requirement | Value | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Operator Time** | **High** | You cannot just "set it and forget it." You must review the logs. |
| **Emotional CPU** | **Maximum** | Your child will complain. The AI will be strict. You must hold the line. |
| **Latency** | **Zero** | When the AI flags "Logic Failure," you must intervene immediately. |
| **Dependency** | **The Parent** | The AI is the tool. **You are the Manager.** If you are weak, the AI becomes a toy. |

# ⚖️ Phase 3: The Protocol (The Subtraction)

> "High performers are not the ones who do the most. They are the ones who decide what NOT to do."

### 1. The Trap of "Doing It All"
In the Legacy OS, we are trained to win through **addition**: reply faster, add more slides, do more tasks. But in the complexity of the AI era, this leads to linear growth and eventual burnout.

To maintain the high performance required in **The Forge (Phase 2)** without crashing, we must switch to a **Subtraction Mindset**.

### 2. The Visual Model (Path A vs. Path B)
*(Image pending upload: `assets/subtraction-model.JPG`)*

### 3. The Upgrade
* **Path A (Legacy):** Effort = Safety. Result = Replaceable Executor.
* **Path B (JY-OS):** Judgment = Value. Result = Irreplaceable Leader.

**The Golden Rule:** Before executing any task, ask: *"If I remove this part, does my message become weaker or clearer?"* If it becomes clearer, delete it.

---

## 🏗 The Architecture
The framework is built on four distinct layers, moving from physical constraints to behavioral execution.

### Layer 1: Kernel (Compute Sovereignty)
* **The Solution:** Understanding "Compute Sovereignty"—the new class divide between those who rent intelligence and those who own their compute stack.

### Layer 2: Firewall (Cognitive Security)
* **The Solution:** A "Cognitive Firewall" that filters input to protect deep thinking and prevent energy leakage.

### Layer 3: Interface (The Personal General Staff)
* **The Solution:** Moving from "using" AI to "commanding" a fleet of 13 specialized agents.
* **The Architecture:** 3 Defense Layers (Tactical, Deep Dive, Audit).
    ![13-Agent System](assets/logan-13-agents-architecture.jpg)
* **[➡️ View The Full 13-Agent Blueprint](workflows/personal_general_staff.md)**

### Layer 4: Runtime (The Super-Individual)
* **The Solution:** The daily behavioral loops and "Family OS" protocols that allow an individual to evolve faster than the environment changes.

## 📚 Protocol Library (Actionable Workflows)
Specific, documented procedures for executing JY-OS in real-world scenarios.

### 🛠 Protocol: Student Output Constraints (Education Module)
**Status:** Active | **Version:** 1.0
**Core Philosophy:** "The student owns the thinking." (Cognitive Ownership)

> "Constraints are not limitations; they are the walls that give the roof strength."

The following **Hard Constraints** are applied to the `Student-Output-Interface` to prevent dependency on the instructor.

| Policy Constraint (The Rule) | Implementation Level (Data Support) | Engineering Logic (Evidence) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **1. English Only** | **YES (100%)** | **Strict API Requirement:** Explicitly required for all active nodes. No localization fallback allowed. |
| **2. No Examples** | **YES (100%)** | **Zero-Shot Prompting:** Providing examples is "strictly prohibited" to prevent pattern matching/copying. Forces raw generation. |
| **3. Finish = Stop** | **YES (High Priority)** | **Efficiency Protocol:** One clean submission is the acceptance criteria. No iterative loops unless critical. |
| **4. No Emotion** | **YES (Adaptive)** | **Tone Control:** Strict for high-resistance nodes; Flexible for sensitive nodes (depending on system load). |
| **5. Cognitive Ownership** | **YES (CORE)** | **Kernel Objective:** If the student does not own the process, the process is terminated. |
