# 🛠 Protocol: The Library Effect Workflow (Environment Design)
**Status:** Production | **Role:** Parent (Environment Designer) | **Objective:** AI Coach + Parental Presence

> "The Library Effect: I am responsible for the task, and the world is quietly with me."

## 🗺 The Workflow Map
This diagram documents the "4-Subject Battle" executed not in isolation, but in a shared "Silent Support" field.

## 🏗 The Environment Architecture

### Step 1: The Challenge (Task Ownership)
**Context:** 4 Subjects (Math, Science, etc.).
**The Shift:**
* **Old Logic:** Stop when "Mom says it's enough" or "Time is up."
* **New Logic:** Stop when the AI Coach says **"You are ready."**
* **Key Principle:** The stop condition is an **Objective Metric**, not an emotional decision.

### Step 2: The Atmosphere (The Library Effect)
**Definition:** A shared space where everyone is working, but no one is interfering.
* **Logan:** Practicing on the table.
* **Parents:** Working quietly nearby.
* **The Vibe:** "Silent Support." Not a lonely room (Isolation), and not a noisy living room (Distraction).
* **Result:** Focus becomes natural, not forced by willpower.

### Step 3: The Verdict (AI as The Judge)
**Role:** **Parents are NOT the Score Police.**
* **The Mechanism:** The AI Coach validates the mastery level.
* **The Psychological Shift:** The child performs for the *Standard*, not to please the *Adult*.
* **Parent Role:** Witness, not Referee.

### Step 4: The Finish (Synchronization)
**Time:** 21:43.
**Action:** "Finish." $\rightarrow$ Family Sync $\rightarrow$ Rest.
* **Significance:** Effort is not endless. It has a clear "Definition of Done."
* **The Signal:** Task Complete = Family Rhythm Synced = Recognition.

## 🚀 Summary: The 3 Core Capabilities
1.  **Ownership:** The child holds the control stick (chats with AI), not the parent.
2.  **Process:** Converting "Stress" into a "Workflow" with a clear ending.
3.  **Safety:** The home becomes a "Support Field," not an "Exam Hall."
