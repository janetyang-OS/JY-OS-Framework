# ⚖️ Principle: The AI Wave Split (Evolutionary Trajectory)
**Status:** System Prediction | **Role:** Strategic Planner | **Objective:** Avoiding the "Operator" Trap

> "AI doesn't replace students. It splits them."

## 📊 The Divergence Map
This diagram predicts the long-term impact of "Question Design" on student capability during the Golden Learning Window.

## 🔀 The Switch: Question Design
The split doesn't happen at university. It happens **now**, determined by the type of tasks the student faces.
* **The Switch:** Is the question "One-Shot" (Left) or "Multi-Turn" (Right)?
* **The Risk:** In the Golden Learning Window, **habits become identity.**

---

## 🛋 The Comfort Path (Left)
* **Action:** Ask AI $\rightarrow$ Get Answer $\rightarrow$ Submit.
* **Illusion:** "I am fast. I am efficient."
* **Reality:** You are an **Operator**. You rely on the tool.
* **The Trap:** **Late Surprise.** When the real world presents a "Missing Spec" problem, the Operator crashes because the tool cannot solve it.

---

## 🧗 The Hard Path (Right)
* **Action:** Spec Check $\rightarrow$ Define Variables $\rightarrow$ Multi-turn Reasoning $\rightarrow$ Peer Review.
* **Reality:** You are a **Commander**. You design the workflow.
* **The Skill:** **System Repair.** When the chain breaks (Chain Test), you don't blame the AI; you fix the link.

## 📉 The Compound Effect
**"Divergence is compounding."**
The difference isn't just 5 points on a test. It's a fundamental split in "Operating System."
* **Identity A:** "I need someone to give me the standard answer."
* **Identity B:** "I will define the model and drive the solution."

### ✅ The Home Checklist (Daily Audit)
To ensure you are on the Right Path, ask:
1.  **Stop:** "If AI gives the answer in one shot, did I stop there?"
2.  **Spec:** "Did I do a Spec Check first?"
3.  **Missing:** "Can I name the missing element?"
4.  **Model:** "Did I use variables to run the model before calculating?"

> **"In the golden learning window, design decides destiny."**
