# 🛠 Protocol: The Parental Noise Protocol (Intervention Logic)
**Status:** Diagnostic | **Role:** Parent (System Architect) | **Objective:** Reducing Friction to Accelerate Growth

> "Intervention belongs at the ARCHITECTURE level, not the TASK level."

## 📊 The Growth Logic Map
This graph maps how "Parental Friction" determines the trajectory of a child's proficiency (CEFR).

## 🟢 Group Alpha: The Doers (Exponential Growth)
**Trajectory:** Slow start $\rightarrow$ **Escape Velocity**.
**Characteristics:**
* **Low Friction:** Parents trust the system and the AI Coach.
* **Architecture Focus:** Parents intervene only on rules, schedules, and roles.
* **Outcome:** The child learns "Risk Assessment" and "Self-Correction."
* **Engineering Logic:** When you don't interrupt the loop, the system optimizes itself.

## 🔴 Group Beta: The Complainers (Stagnation)
**Trajectory:** Flatline / Noise.
**Characteristics:**
* **High Friction:** Parents micromanage every task. "Why did you write this?" "Is the AI wrong?"
* **The Trap:** **Excuses.** Parents use complaints to buffer their own anxiety.
* **Outcome:**
    * Child learns: "Someone will block the pain for me."
    * Result: Copy-Paste behavior, Stagnation, No internalization.

## ⚙️ The Core Insight: Architecture vs. Task
**The Problem:** Most parents intervene at the **Task Level** (fixing the homework, rewriting the prompt).
**The Solution:** Intervene at the **Architecture Level** (adjusting the schedule, refining the rubric).

### 🛠 The 3-Line Operating Manual
1.  **Diagnosis:** Look at the graph. Are you on the Green Line or the Red Line?
2.  **The Check:** Before you interfere, ask: **"Is this an Architecture problem, or am I just trying to block their discomfort?"**
3.  **The Action:** Every time you step back, the growth slope has a chance to curve upward.
