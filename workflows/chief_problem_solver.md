# 🛠 Protocol: Chief Problem Solver Mom (The Curator Model)
**Status:** Production | **Role:** Parent as Curator | **Trigger:** Academic Failure/Confusion
**Case Study:** Grade 7 Math (Slope/Visual Gap)

> "A child doesn't need a know-it-all parent. He needs a parent who models 'how to learn' in the face of the unknown."

## 🗺 The Workflow Map
This flowchart documents the transition from "Panic" to "Meta-Skill Acquisition."

## ⚙️ The 4-Step Execution Loop

### 🛑 Step 1: Redefine the Problem
* **The Symptom:** Assessment Failure (e.g., "Slope" unit failed).
* **Legacy Reaction:** "Did you listen in class?" (Blame).
* **JY-OS Diagnosis:** **"Visual Gap."**
    * *Logic:* It’s not stupidity. The child cannot *see* the math. The abstract formula ($y=mx+b$) has disconnected from physical reality.

### 🧠 Step 2: The Attitude (Stop Panic)
* **The Shift:** **Parent Learning First.**
* **Action:** Do not outsource immediately.
* **Modeling:** Demonstrate that "Not knowing" is not shameful; it is just the starting line. "I will figure this out."

### 🔍 Step 3: The Filter (Human-in-the-Loop)
* **Role:** **AI Curator.**
* **Process:**
    1.  Ask AI for resources (Videos/Simulations).
    2.  **The Cut:** Ruthlessly delete boring text/dry formulas.
    3.  **The Keep:** Select only clear animations/interactive demos.
* **Why:** You know your "Client" (the child). You filter the signal from the noise.

### 💡 Step 4: Targeted Input
* **The Result:** "Visual Learning."
* **The Outcome:** The lightbulb moment isn't memorizing the answer; it's understanding the *model* (e.g., seeing the car drive up the slope).

## 🚀 The Outcome: Meta-Skills
The goal is not the "A+". The goal is the thought bubble on the right:

> **"Mom is strong = I can learn anything."**

* **Metric:** Confidence in tackling unknown problems.
* **Asset:** A resilient Operating System for overcoming failure.
