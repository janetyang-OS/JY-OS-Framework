## 🛋️ Path A: Comfort First (Top)
**The Strategy:** Remove Friction.
* **Actions:** "Avoid discomfort," "Stay happy," "Let me fix that for you."
* **Short Term:** Smooth trajectory. High family harmony.
* **The Event:** **The Wall.**
    * Eventually, the timeline reaches a point (Adult/Workplace) where the parent cannot remove the friction.
    * Because the child has zero "climbing muscles," the vertical wall is insurmountable.
* **Engineering Term:** **"Resilience Debt."** You are borrowing comfort from the future at high interest.

## 💪 Path B: Capacity First (Bottom)
**The Strategy:** Build Tolerance.
* **Actions:** "Finish the task," "Learn to handle discomfort," "This you can sustain."
* **Short Term:** Bumpy. Complaints. Noise.
* **The Event:** **The Slope.**
    * When they reach adulthood, the line flattens—not because life got easier, but because their **Capacity** exceeds the **Load**.
* **Engineering Term:** **"Stress Testing."** Small, controlled stressors build system integrity.

## 🎯 The Core Insight
**Why I drew this:**
I see the workplace reality every day. I see people who have no choice but to hit the wall.
I am teaching my son to manage:
* Teachers
* Classmates
* Systems
* AI Coaches

**The Ultimate Goal:**
It is not about "suffering." It is about **Agency**.
> **"Freedom requires skills."**
> (自由需要能力)

Freedom is not a feeling; it is a capacity state. If you cannot handle the friction, you are not free to choose your path.
