# 🕹️ Protocol: The JY-OS Control Tower (System Operations)
**Status:** Admin Console | **Role:** Air Traffic Controller | **Objective:** Dynamic Load Balancing

## 🗺 The Admin Console
This diagram illustrates the operational workflow of the Parent as the System Administrator.

## 🏗 The Separation of Powers
**The Crisis of Traditional Parenting:**
Parents try to be the **Legislator** (Make rules), the **Police** (Enforce rules), and the **Counselor** (Comfort child) all at once. This causes conflict.

**The JY-OS Solution:**
* **The Parent (Decision Core):** The Legislator. You set the policy.
* **The AI Runtime:** The Police. It enforces the constraints (e.g., "No examples allowed").
* **The Child:** The User.
* **Benefit:** When the system blocks the child, you can stand *beside* them as an ally: *"Wow, this Strict Mode is tough. Let's figure out how to solve it together."*

## 📡 Left Side: Behavior Telemetry (Inputs)
Stop guessing. Look at the dashboard.
Instead of "I feel like he is lazy," read the gauges:
* **Self-Correction Rate:** Is it rising or falling?
* **Emotional Noise Level:** Is the "Engine" overheating?
* **Focus Duration:** How much fuel is left?
* **Error Patterns:** Is it a random glitch or a structural bug?

---

## 🎚️ Right Side: Control Actions (Outputs)
We do not "nag." We **tune parameters**.
* **Load Balancing:**
    * *Signal:* High Emotional Noise. $\rightarrow$ *Action:* Switch to `PRACTICE` Mode (Reduce Friction).
    * *Signal:* Repeated careless errors. $\rightarrow$ *Action:* Activate `Constraint` (Increase Friction).
* **Debug Template Selection:** Apply specific patches from Protocol #26 (The Cheat Sheet).

## 🎯 The Core Philosophy
**Does AI replace the parent?**
No. AI is the Infrastructure. You are the Governor.
* AI does not decide *values*.
* AI does not decide *direction*.
* AI executes the **decisions** you make based on the **data** you see.

> **"Don't control the child. Control the system."**
