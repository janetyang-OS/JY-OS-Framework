# 🏗 Architecture: The 3-Layer AI Coach OS (Parent OS Manifesto)
**Status:** Core Architecture | **Role:** System Architect | **Objective:** Cognitive Sovereignty

> "When AI enters education, parenting becomes System Engineering."

## 🗺 The System Blueprint
This diagram illustrates the full stack of the AI Coach: From the non-negotiable Kernel to the flexible Runtime.

## 🔒 Layer 1: Behavioral Constitution (The Kernel)
**Function:** Non-Negotiable Core & Access Control.
**The "Hard Constraints":**
* **English Only:** Force immersion.
* **No Rewriting/No Examples:** Prevent "Thinking Theft."
* **Cognitive Ownership Protection:** The student must own the logic.
* **Engineering Logic:** This is the **Security Layer**. If AI bypasses this (by doing the work for the student), the system is considered "breached."

## ⚙️ Layer 2: Mode Engine (Runtime Behavior Control)
**Function:** Dynamic Behavior Switching (The State Machine).
**The Modes:**
1.  **🔒 STRICT Mode:** High friction. AI demands precision. No hints. (Discipline Training)
2.  **💪 PRACTICE Mode:** Medium friction. Scaffolding allowed. (Skill Building)
3.  **🕒 EXAM Mode:** Time pressure. Simulation. (Stress Testing)

**The Innovation:** Parenting is no longer emotional reaction; it is **Programmable State Management**.

---

## 📝 Layer 3: Task Runtime Injection (Execution Layer)
**Function:** Daily Operations.
**The Modules:**
* Daily Study Plan
* Writing Tasks
* Reflection Logs
* Speaking Practice
* **Flexibility:** Because the Kernel and Engine are stable, this layer is "Hot-Swappable." You can change the subject (Math vs. Science) without breaking the system.

---

## 🕶️ Layer 0: The Hidden Layer (Orchestration)
**Who:** The Parent (You).
**Role:** The System Architect.
* You do not teach the math.
* You **Governance** the system.
* You decide when to switch from `PRACTICE` mode to `STRICT` mode.
* You audit the logs to ensure the Kernel is secure.

## 🎯 The Core Formula
$$\text{Stable Kernel} + \text{Flexible Runtime} = \text{Scalable AI Coaching System}$$

We are not just building a tool. We are designing a human operating system that **retains cognitive sovereignty** in the age of AI.
