# ⚖️ Principle: The Question Design Matrix (AI-Proof Assessment)
**Status:** Educational Engineering | **Role:** Teacher/Parent | **Objective:** Moving from "One-Shot" to "Reasoning Chains"

> "AI doesn't break education. Weak question design does."

## 📊 The Design Map
This diagram classifies assessment types based on their resilience to AI shortcuts.

## 📐 The 2 Axes of Assessment
1.  **X-Axis: Answer Space (答案空間)**
    * **Small:** Fixed options (MCQ), Single number answer.
    * **Large:** Open modeling, Multiple valid approaches.
2.  **Y-Axis: Reasoning Chain Length (推理鏈長度)**
    * **Short:** 1-2 steps to solve.
    * **Long:** Multi-step dependencies, Intermediate results required.

---

## 🛑 The Danger Zone (One-Shot AI)
**Quadrants:** Bottom-Left (MCQ) & Bottom-Right (Simple Open).
**The Trap:**
* AI can solve these in **One Shot**.
* The student learns "Pattern Matching" or "Copy-Paste," not thinking.
* **Verdict:** If 80% of your assessment is here, AI *will* hollow out the learning.

## 🧠 The Thinking Zone (Multi-Turn AI)
**Quadrants:** Top-Left (Structured Multi-Step) & Top-Right (Open Modeling).
**The Shield:**
* **Top-Left:** Requires "Step Management." The AI is fast, but if the student cannot track the chain, they will crash in the middle.
* **Top-Right (The Logan Case):** **"Missing Element."**
    * *Scenario:* The problem is deliberately incomplete (e.g., missing a 3D reference).
    * *Requirement:* The student must first **Define the Model** (Spec Reading) before calculation is possible.
    * *AI Role:* AI cannot solve it instantly. It becomes a partner for "Spec Checking" and "Variable Simulation."

## 🚀 The Shift: From Answer to Spec
In the AI Era, the value of "Getting the Answer" drops to zero.
The value shifts to:
1.  **Spec Reading:** Identifying missing data.
2.  **Model Definition:** Setting up the variables ($k$, $x$).
3.  **Chain Management:** Handling the output of Step 3 as the input for Step 4.

**The Golden Rule:**
> "If an assessment can be solved by AI in one shot, it is measuring **Obedience**, not **Thinking**."
