# 🛠 Tool: The Behavior Debugger (Parenting as Constraint Engineering)
**Status:** User Interface (UI) | **Role:** Site Reliability Engineer (SRE) | **Objective:** Troubleshooting

> "Don't control the child. Debug the system."

## 🗺 The Troubleshooting UI
This cheat sheet translates common "Parental Complaints" into "Engineering Actions."

## ⚙️ How to Use This Tool
This is your **Action Menu** when things go wrong. Do not react emotionally; follow the columns.

### Column 1: The User Bug Report (Parent Complaint)
* **What you say:** "He keeps asking for examples!" / "He is procrastinating!"
* **Engineering View:** This is just a symptom. Do not treat the symptom.

### Column 2: The Diagnosis (Engineering Translation)
* **The Shift:** We reframe moral judgments into system faults.
    * "Lazy" $\rightarrow$ **Task Friction too high**.
    * "Copying" $\rightarrow$ **Cognitive Ownership Leak**.
    * "Drama" $\rightarrow$ **Emotional Noise Contamination**.
* **Why:** You can't fix "Laziness." You **can** fix "Friction."

### Column 3: The Constraint Rule (The AI Coach Configuration)
* **The Fix:** What rule do we enforce in the Kernel?
    * *Leak:* **No Examples + Ask-Back Protocol.**
    * *No Boundary:* **Sentence Limit + Hard Stop.**
    * *Panic:* **Facts-Only Mode.**

### Column 4: Metrics to Watch (Telemetry)
* **The Validation:** How do we know it worked?
    * Watch the **Dependency Frequency**.
    * Watch the **Self-Correction Rate**.
    * Watch the **Emotional Noise Level**.

### Column 5: The Tuning Knob (Action)
* **The Governance:**
    * **Increase refusal strictness.**
    * **Tighten limits.**
    * **Lower difficulty.**
    * **Switch Modes (Practice $\leftrightarrow$ Strict).**

## 🧩 Common Debugging Scenarios

| Bug (Complaint) | Diagnosis | The Fix (Constraint) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **"Asks for examples"** | Cognitive Ownership Leak | **No Examples Rule** (Force them to define the model first). |
| **"Too many sentences"** | No Output Boundary | **Hard Sentence Limit** (e.g., Max 5 sentences). |
| **"Procrastinates"** | High Task Friction | **Micro-Steps + Timebox** (Lower the activation energy). |
| **"Emotional Writing"** | Noise Contamination | **Facts-Only Mode** (Reject all subjective adjectives). |
| **"Repeats Mistakes"** | Unchecked Error Loop | **Forced Correction Gate** (Must pass check before proceeding). |
