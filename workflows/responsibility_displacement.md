# ⚖️ Principle: The Responsibility Displacement Model
**Status:** System Law | **Role:** Parent (Architect) | **Objective:** Understanding the "Conservation of Responsibility"

> "Responsibility does not disappear. It shifts."

## 📊 The Displacement Map
This diagram illustrates the inverse relationship between "Parental Intervention" and "Child Ownership."

## 🏗 The 3 Structural Components

### 1. The Input: Parental Intervention Level (Left)
* **Low:** Trust & Autonomy.
* **High:** Micromanagement & Excuses.
* **Note:** This scale does not judge *intention* (which is usually love), only *intensity*.

### 2. The Buffer: The Displacement Zone (Center)
* **What forms here?** Excuses, Mediation, Noise.
* **Function:** This zone "catches" the responsibility that the child was supposed to hold.
* **The Cost:** It creates a "Safety Net" that prevents the child from feeling the weight of their choices.

### 3. The Output: Child Responsibility Ownership (Right)
* **High:** Self-Driven, Problem Solving.
* **Low:** Passive, Dependent.
* **The Law:** As the parent lifts the weight (Left goes up), the child's muscle atrophies (Right goes down).

## ⚙️ The System Law (Conservation of Responsibility)
**"Responsibility does not disappear. It shifts."**

* If you explain the homework to the teacher $\rightarrow$ You took the responsibility.
* If you check the bag for them $\rightarrow$ You took the responsibility.
* If you argue with the AI Coach $\rightarrow$ You took the responsibility.

**The Structural Result:**
The system (the child) cannot grow because the load required for growth has been displaced to the parent or the "Noise Zone."

## 🎯 The Diagnosis
This model is not for blaming. It is for locating the load.
**Ask:** "Where does the responsibility currently sit in our system?"
* Is it on the **Executor** (Child)?
* Or is it in the **Buffer** (Parent/Excuses)?
