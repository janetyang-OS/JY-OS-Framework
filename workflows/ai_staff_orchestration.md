## ❓ State 1: The Confusion (Instruction Mode)
**The Bug:** "Study Hard!"
* **The Engineering View:** This is a **Zero Information Command**.
* **Child's Decoder:** "How hard? Until when? Am I failing?"
* **Result:** Stress without a path.

---

## 🎯 State 2: Defining the Target (Mission Mode)
**The Fix:** We convert "Education" into "Mission Specs."
* **From:** "I hope you improve."
* **To:** "Target: Year 9 Math Solid 6."
* **Mechanism:** Weekly Milestones + Daily Quests.
* **The Shift:** Focus moves from *Emotion* (Anxiety) to *Execution* (Tasks).

## 📊 State 3: The Dashboard (Gamification)
**Concept:** Gamification is not about rewards; it is about **Visibility of Growth**.
* **The Metric:** "I know my progress."
* **Result:** Anxiety drops because ambiguity drops.

## 🤖 State 4: The 13-Agent AI Staff (The Runtime)

This is not one chatbot; it is a **Specialized Team**.

### The Command Center 🧠

* **Role:** Directs the agents. The Human in the Loop.

### The Specialized Agents (Tactical Support)
* **Math AI:** Strategy & Error Analysis.

## 🔗 Integration: Physical + Cognitive
