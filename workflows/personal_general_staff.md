# 🏗 Architecture: The Personal General Staff (13-Agent System)
**Status:** Production | **Target:** Logan (Commander)
**Objective:** Replacing "Tutors" with a specialized, layered AI Team.

> "Many mothers wake up thinking about what to put in a bento box. I wake up thinking: Which AI Coach does Logan need today?"

## 🗺 The Architecture Map
The system is organized into three defense layers, moving from fast tactical response to deep strategic thinking.

## 🛡 Layer 1: The Tactical Unit (Survival & Speed)
**Mission:** Classroom Survival (即戰支援).
**Context:** European School (TES) Environment.
* **The Pressure:** Teachers ask "Why? Explain. Compare." abruptly.
* **The Rule:** "Reaction time > 3 seconds = Lost Opportunity."

### The Agents
* **⚡ Quick English:** Instant clarity, short sentences, debate-ready points.
* **⚡ Quick Math:** Process verification and rapid solving.
* **⚡ Quick Science:** Concept checks to prevent directional errors.
* **⚡ Quick I&S:** Rapid fact retrieval and context positioning.

**Protocol:** Fast, concise, align with Rubrics. No teaching, just tactical support.

## ⚓ Layer 2: The Deep Dive Unit (Strategy)
**Mission:** Capability Chassis (能力底盤).
**Context:** The foundation that determines if he is a "Thinking Human" or just a "Tool User."

### The Agents
* **🏛 Core English:** Long-form writing, argumentation, structural logic.
* **📐 Core Math:** Deep logic, proofs, reasoning.
* **🧬 Core Science:** Experimental design, model understanding.
* **🌍 Core I&S (Individuals & Societies):** **Systems Thinking.** Moving beyond dates and names to understand causal relationships, historical context, and societal patterns.
* **🗼 French Coach:** **Immersive Stability.** Focus on steady input to prevent language barriers from dragging down academic performance.

## 🧠 Layer 3: The Audit & Meta Layer (Wisdom)
**Mission:** The Human Core.
**Context:** The "Soul" of the system.

### 1. The Meta Coach (The CPU)
* **Role:** Training the 5 Core Human Skills.
* **Skills:** Critical Thinking, Communication, Innovation, Interdisciplinary, Debate.
* **Logic:** This is the final authority of humans in the AI era.

### 2. The GitHub Coach (Life Version Control)
* **Role:** Identity Officer.
* **Workflow:** Logan chats about frustration/wins $\rightarrow$ AI converts to Markdown Log $\rightarrow$ Logan audits & Commits.
* **Concept:** "Not a diary, but **Life Version Control**." Transforming emotions into structured assets.

### 3. Gemini Visual Auditors (Science & Math Gems)
* **💎 Gemini Science Gem:** Multi-modal Visual Audit. Scans handwritten diagrams and experimental setups to verify logic.
* **💎 Gemini Math Gem:** Reasoning Verification. Checks the *process* of handwritten math steps, not just the final answer.

## ⚙️ The Tech Stack (Hybrid Model)
**Philosophy:** "Tools have no loyalty; only results matter."

| Tool | Function | Why? |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Gemini (Science/Math Gems)** | **Audit / Visual** | Superior in visual verification and reasoning auditing (reading handwriting/diagrams). |
| **ChatGPT** | **Structure / Text** | More stable adherence to complex linguistic prompts and rubrics. |

## 🎨 UX Design: Frictionless Entry
**Problem:** How to prevent "Choice Paralysis" with 13 agents?
**Solution:** Product Management Mindset.
* **Zero Friction:** He doesn't think about "Prompts" or "Settings."
* **Intuitive Flow:** He only needs to know *what class* he is in. The system handles the rest.
* **Logic:** "This is product design, not parenting."
