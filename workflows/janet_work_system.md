## 🏢 The Department Structure
I do not write everything. I do not analyze everything. I **Orchestrate & Judge**.

### 🟢 1. The Editorial Unit (ChatGPT)
* **Role:** Copy & Structure (參謀).
* **Function:**
    * Drafting raw text.
    * Tone adjustment.
    * Structural organization.
* **Logic:** I do not outsource "Thought." I outsource "Language Processing."

### 🟣 2. The Analysis Unit (Claude)
* **Role:** Deep Dive (分析師).
* **Function:**
    * Finding blind spots.
    * Extending logic chains.
    * Strategic critique.
* **Workflow:** Every strategy doc goes to Claude for a "Red Team" challenge.

### 🔵 3. The Intelligence Unit (Perplexity)
* **Role:** The Hunter (獵犬).
* **Function:**
    * Live Data Retrieval (CES, Startup News, Market Trends).
    * **Rule:** "Give me the latest intel, no fluff."

### 🔴 4. The Engineering Unit (Gemini)
* **Role:** The CTO (工程師).
* **Function:**
    * Markdown conversion.
    * GitHub documentation.
    * Technical formatting.

## 🧠 The Memory Layer (Notion AI)
* **The "N" Block:** This is the **Second Brain**.
* **RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation):**
    * I store all project notes, analysis, and family systems here.
    * I do not "re-think" from zero; I retrieve context and feed it to the agents.

---

## 🎯 The Output Logic
**Janet $\rightarrow$ James (The Client)**
* **The Red Arrow:** The final output to the real world (James) **MUST** pass through the Human Commander (Janet).
* **Why:** Framing, nuance, and "what NOT to say" are human responsibilities. AI generates the blocks; I build the house.
