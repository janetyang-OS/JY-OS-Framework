## 🗓 Section 1: Weekday Flow (The Leverage)
**The Shift:** From "Textbooks & Cramming" (Old Way) $\rightarrow$ "13 AI Coaches" (New Way).

### 1. The Method: Dialogue > Reading
* **Old Way:** High Friction. Reading static text. Low retention.
* **New Way:** **High Density Output.**
    * Scenario: Science Exam (Criteria A).
    * Action: 15 minutes of "Sparring" with the AI Coach.
    * Metric: It is not about *time spent*; it is about *concepts cleared*.

### 2. The AI Checkpoint (Debug & Polish)
**Concept:** "Code Review for Homework."
* Logan writes the draft (Human Output).
* AI performs the QA (Quality Assurance):
    * *Structure Check:* "Did I miss a requirement?"
    * *Logic Debug:* "Is my argument sound?"
    * *Polish:* "Where is the language vague?"
* **Result:** Certainty & Confidence. He goes to sleep knowing the work is solid.

### 3. The Sleep Protocol (System Reset)
**Hard Rule:** Sleep at 21:00.
* **Logic:** We prioritize "Tomorrow's Brain" over "Today's Cramming."
* **The Math:** Sleep deprivation = Cognitive Debt. It is a bad long-term investment.

## 🎮 Section 2: Weekend Flow (The Recharge)
**Concept:** Human OS Maintenance.
**Activities:** Video Games, Anime, Board Games.
**The Engineering View:**
* **Games:** Decision training, Risk assessment.
* **Anime:** Narrative understanding, World-building.
* **Board Games:** Negotiation, Social connection.
* **Family Role:** No study pressure. Pure connection.

## 🎯 The Core Philosophy
**Why this works:**
Most families run on **High Friction × Emotional Drive** (Fear).
We run on **Low Friction × System Feedback** (Design).

**The 3 System Questions:**
1.  **Where did we come from?** (GitHub Logs = The Previous Version)
2.  **Who are we?** (Operators of the System)
3.  **Where are we going?** (Iterative Roadmap)

> **"Others fight daily battles with emotion. We upgrade the model daily with design."**
