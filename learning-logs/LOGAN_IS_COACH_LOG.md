# Logan — Individuals & Societies AI Coach Learning Journey
*(Public Cognitive Changelog)*

> **Methodology Note:**
> This log documents how thinking quality changes over time, not grades.
> AI is used as a coach and evaluator, not a content generator.

## v0.3.0 — Individuals & Societies
**Observed by AI Coach**

### 🧠 [Cognitive Shift]
**From “event description” → “pattern recognition”**

- **AI Coach Observation:**
  Logan no longer limits responses to restating historical or social facts. He increasingly identifies trends, inequality, distribution, and systemic patterns across cases.
- **Interpretation:**
  This marks a transition from content recall to structural understanding, a key Pre-IB indicator.
> **Admin Note (Human):**
> This explains why he disengages from rote tasks but becomes highly focused during debates or comparative analysis.

### 🔗 [Skill Build]
**Multi-step causal reasoning emerging**

- **AI Coach Observation:**
  Logan now uses chained reasoning structures (e.g. `X → Y → Z`) to explain social and historical outcomes, rather than relying on single-cause explanations.
- **System Log:**
  `Detected consistent multi-step causality in written responses.`
- **Assessment:**
  This level of reasoning aligns with Pre-IB / early IB HL thinking patterns.

### 📊 [Evidence Use]
**Shift from “data as decoration” → “data as argumentative tool”**

- **AI Coach Observation:**
  Logan increasingly distinguishes between:
  1. Data that exists
  2. Data that *actually* supports a claim
  He is beginning to evaluate whether evidence strengthens or weakens an argument.
- **Interpretation:**
  This shows emerging Criterion C (Evaluation) awareness.

### ⚠️ [Warning]
**Over-acceptance of polished narratives**

- **AI Coach Note:**
  On some topics, Logan adopts mature-sounding mainstream explanations too quickly, without sufficient interrogation of bias or perspective.
- **Risk Identified:**
  - Comfort with “reasonable” narratives
  - Insufficient challenge to dominant frameworks
- **Training Focus:**
  Perspective analysis & bias detection.

### 🧭 [Known Issue]
**Scale switching not yet fully automated**

- **AI Coach Observation:**
  - Strong at global / system-level analysis
  - Inconsistent attention to local / individual impact
- **Example Pattern:**
  Global inequality identified → local human consequences sometimes underdeveloped.
> **Admin Note (Human):**
> We are deliberately introducing prompts that force micro–macro comparison to address this gap.

## 🎯 [Readiness Indicator]
**Approaching IB Group 3 HL thinking pattern**

**AI Coach Assessment:**
- [x] Analytical depth
- [x] Causal reasoning
- [x] Early evaluative judgment
- [ ] Precision (Developing)
- [ ] Perspective comparison density (Developing)

**Overall Status:**
`Pre-IB → Early IB HL trajectory confirmed`

### 🧪 Methodology Note (Public Transparency)
AI does not write Logan’s final answers. AI evaluates:
* Reasoning structure
* Evidence quality
* Cognitive progression

*Missing steps = Redo | No evidence = Incomplete*
This log reflects **process data**, not performance inflation.

### 🧭 Why This Log Exists
Traditional education reports outcomes (Grades).
This log documents how thinking evolves.
* **Grades** are lagging indicators.
* **Cognitive shifts** are leading indicators.

### 🔐 Ethics & Privacy
* No personal identifiers beyond first name.
* No raw school submissions published.
* Focus is on learning architecture, not the child.

### 🏁 Status Summary
* **Cognitive OS:** Upgrading
* **Evidence discipline:** Improving
* **Risk factor (overconfidence):** Actively managed
* **IB Group 3 readiness:** On track

**Next Version Target:** `v0.4.0`
**Focus:** Bias origin analysis & evidence hierarchy judgment
